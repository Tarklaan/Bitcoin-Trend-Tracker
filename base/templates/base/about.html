        <h2>The Role of Market Sentiment</h2>
        <p>Market sentiment plays a crucial role in predicting cryptocurrency prices. Unlike traditional financial assets, cryptocurrencies are highly influenced by public perception and news events. Positive news, endorsements from influential figures, or technological advancements can drive prices up, while negative news, regulatory concerns, or security breaches can lead to sharp declines. Our platform incorporates sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment from various sources, including social media, news articles, and forums. By understanding market sentiment, our models can better predict how public perception will impact future price movements.</p>
